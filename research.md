# ðŸ”­ Research Projects

My research portfolio spans two key areas of modern astrophysics: the final stages of stellar evolution and the dynamic chemistry of planet-forming regions.

## **Current Research: Astrochemistry and Protoplanetary Disks**
*(PhD Research at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile)*

### Project: Nitrogen Isotope Chemistry in Protoplanetary Environments

**Focus:** Investigating the evolution and fractionation of nitrogen-bearing compounds in the disks where planets form.

**Description:**
As a PhD student, my specialization is the **nitrogen isotope chemistry** within protoplanetary disks. My research is centered on analyzing **ALMA observations** of molecules like **hydrogen cyanide (HCN)** and its isotopologues. By studying the isotopic ratios and spatial distribution of these molecules, I aim to understand how nitrogen-bearing compounds evolve during the planet formation process and how these processes might contribute to the emergence of **prebiotic chemistry**. This work is conducted within the [Astrochemistry group at PUC](https://vvguzman.com/).

**Key Techniques & Tools:** ALMA data reduction and analysis, Radiative Transfer Modeling, Isotopic Fractionation, Radio interferometry, CASA, etc.

## **Past Research: Stellar Populations and White Dwarfs**
* (M.Sc. Research)*

### Publication: [Detection of a new sample of Galactic white dwarfs in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450292) 

**Focus:** Identifying and characterizing a new population of **Galactic white dwarfs** (WDs) using UV and optical data.

**Description:**
This project demonstrated the efficacy of the **Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)** combined with **Gaia DR3** data for large-scale white dwarf discovery. We identified 43 single WDs (37 new detections) and used WD evolutionary models to determine their masses, effective temperatures ($T_{eff}$), and cooling ages. The work included the detection of new extremely low-mass WD candidates and an estimate of the local WD space density ($\approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{pc}^{-3}$).

**Key Techniques & Tools:** Multi-wavelength Photometry (UVIT}, Gaia, Spectral Energy Distribution analysis, Stellar Evolutionary Models, Python scripting.
