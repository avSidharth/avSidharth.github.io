# ðŸ”­ Research Projects

My research portfolio spans two key areas of modern astrophysics: the final stages of stellar evolution and the dynamic chemistry of planet-forming regions.

## **Current Research: Astrochemistry and Protoplanetary Disks**
*($\text{PhD}$ Research at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile)*

### Project: Nitrogen Isotope Chemistry in Protoplanetary Environments

**Focus:** Investigating the evolution and fractionation of $\text{nitrogen-bearing compounds}$ in the disks where planets form.

**Description:**
As a $\text{PhD}$ student, my specialization is the **nitrogen isotope chemistry** within protoplanetary disks. My research is centered on analyzing **$\text{ALMA}$ observations** of molecules like **hydrogen cyanide ($\text{HCN}$)** and its isotopologues. By studying the isotopic ratios and spatial distribution of these molecules, I aim to understand how nitrogen-bearing compounds evolve during the planet formation process and how these processes might contribute to the emergence of **prebiotic chemistry**. This work is conducted within the Astrochemistry Group at **$\text{PUC}$ Chile**.

**Key Techniques & Tools:** $\text{ALMA}$ data analysis, Radiative Transfer Modeling, Isotopic Fractionation, $\text{Python}$ ($\text{CASA}$, $\text{Astropy}$).

## **Past Research: Stellar Populations and White Dwarfs**
*($\text{M.Sc.}$ Research)*

### Publication: Detection of a new sample of Galactic white dwarfs in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud

**Focus:** Identifying and characterizing a new population of **Galactic white dwarfs** ($\text{WDs}$) using $\text{UV}$ and optical data.

**Description:**
This project demonstrated the efficacy of the **Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope ($\text{UVIT}$)** combined with **$\text{Gaia DR3}$** data for large-scale white dwarf discovery. We identified $43$ single $\text{WDs}$ ($37$ new detections) and used $\text{WD}$ evolutionary models to determine their masses, effective temperatures ($T_{\text{eff}}$), and cooling ages. The work included the detection of extremely low-mass $\text{WD}$ candidates and an estimate of the local $\text{WD}$ space density ($\approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{pc}^{-3}$).

**Key Techniques & Tools:** Multi-wavelength Photometry ($\text{UVIT}$, $\text{Gaia}$), Spectral Energy Distribution ($\text{SED}$) analysis, Stellar Evolutionary Models, $\text{Python}$ scripting.
