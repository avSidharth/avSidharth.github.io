# ðŸ”­ Research Projects

I have worked on two fascinating extremes of stellar evolution â€” from the dying embers of stars to the chemistry that seeds new planetary systems.

## **Current Research: Astrochemistry and Protoplanetary Disks**
*Ph.D. Research at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile*

### Project: *Nitrogen Isotope Chemistry in Protoplanetary Environments*

**Focus:** Investigating the evolution and fractionation of nitrogen-bearing compounds in planet-forming disks.

**Description:**  
As a Ph.D. student, I specialize in the **nitrogen isotope chemistry** of **protoplanetary disks**. My work involves analyzing **ALMA observations** of molecules such as **hydrogen cyanide (HCN)** and its isotopologues to study isotopic ratios and their spatial distributions. These diagnostics help us trace the **chemical and physical processes** that shape the evolution of nitrogen-bearing species during planet formation and their possible link to **prebiotic chemistry**.  

This research is conducted within the [Astrochemistry Group at PUC](https://vvguzman.com/).

**Key Techniques & Tools:**  
ALMA data reduction and analysis â€¢ Radiative transfer modeling â€¢ Isotopic fractionation â€¢ Radio interferometry â€¢ CASA â€¢ Python-based data analysis

## **Past Research: Stellar Populations and White Dwarfs**
*M.Sc. Research*

### Publication:  
[**Detection of a new sample of Galactic white dwarfs in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud**](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450292)

**Focus:** Identification and characterization of a new population of **Galactic white dwarfs** (WDs) using UV and optical data.

**Description:**  
This project demonstrated the power of combining **Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)** and **Gaia DR3** data for large-scale WD discovery. We identified **43 single white dwarfs** (37 of them new) and derived their **masses**, **effective temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$)**, and **cooling ages** using WD evolutionary models. The study also reported **new extremely low-mass WD candidates** and estimated a **local WD space density** of approximately  
$\rho_{\text{WD}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{pc}^{-3}$.

**Key Techniques & Tools:**  
Multi-wavelength photometry (UVIT, Gaia) â€¢ Spectral energy distribution analysis â€¢ Stellar evolutionary models â€¢ Python scripting
