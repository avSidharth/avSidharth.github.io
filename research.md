# üî≠ Research Projects

I have worked on two fascinating extremes of stellar evolution ‚Äî from the dying embers of stars to the chemistry that seeds new planetary systems.

---

## Current Research: 
## **Astrochemistry and Protoplanetary Disks**
*Ph.D. Research at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile*

### Project: *Nitrogen Isotope Chemistry in Protoplanetary Environments*

**Focus:** Investigating the evolution and fractionation of nitrogen-bearing compounds in planet-forming disks.

**Description:**  
As a Ph.D. student, I specialize in the **nitrogen isotope chemistry** of **protoplanetary disks**. My work involves analyzing **ALMA observations** of molecules such as **hydrogen cyanide (HCN)** and its isotopologues to study isotopic ratios and their spatial distributions. These diagnostics help us trace the **chemical and physical processes** that shape the evolution of nitrogen-bearing species during planet formation and their possible link to **prebiotic chemistry**.  

This research is conducted within the [Astrochemistry Group at PUC](https://vvguzman.com/).

**Key Techniques & Tools:**  
ALMA data reduction and analysis ‚Ä¢ Radiative transfer modeling ‚Ä¢ Isotopic fractionation ‚Ä¢ Radio interferometry ‚Ä¢ CASA ‚Ä¢ Python-based data analysis

## Past Research Projects:
## **Study of White Dwarfs using AstroSat/UVIT and Gaia DR3**
*Research carried out as a Project Fellow at CHRIST University, Bangalore, India*

### Publication  
[**Detection of a new sample of Galactic white dwarfs in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud**](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450292)

**Focus:** Identification and characterization of a new population of **Galactic white dwarfs** (WDs) using UV and optical data.

**Description:**  
This project demonstrated the power of combining **Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)** and **Gaia DR3** data for large-scale WD discovery. We identified **43 single white dwarfs** (37 of them new) and derived their **masses**, **effective temperatures** (*T*<sub>eff</sub>), and **cooling ages** using WD evolutionary models. The study also reported **new extremely low-mass WD candidates** and estimated a **local WD space density** of approximately  
œÅ<sub>WD</sub> ‚âà 1.3 √ó 10<sup>‚àí3</sup> pc<sup>‚àí3</sup>.

**Key Techniques & Tools:**  
Multi-wavelength photometry (UVIT, Gaia) ‚Ä¢ Spectral energy distribution analysis ‚Ä¢ Stellar evolutionary models ‚Ä¢ Python scripting

## **Disk Evolution in Classical Be Stars**
* Master's Thesis*
**Guide:** Dr. Blesson Mathew, Associate Professor, Dept. of Physics and Electronics, CHRIST University, Bangalore, India

**Title:** *Study of Disk Evolution in Classical Be Stars Using LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectra*

**Description:**  
This thesis utilized **medium-resolution (R ‚âà 7500) LAMOST DR7 spectra** to study disk evolution in Classical Be (CBe) stars. A total of **10 candidates** exhibiting **line profile variability (LPV)** and **15 showing variations in HŒ± emission strength** were identified from multi-epoch data. Light curve analyses were performed to determine **variability periods**, providing insight into the **disk formation mechanisms** and the potential role of **binarity** in driving the ‚ÄúBe phenomenon.‚Äù

**Key Techniques & Tools:**  
LAMOST spectroscopy ‚Ä¢ Time-series analysis ‚Ä¢ Light curve modeling ‚Ä¢ Disk variability studies ‚Ä¢ Python scripting
