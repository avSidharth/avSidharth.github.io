title: Hi, this is Sidharth!
subtitle: PhD Student in Astronomy & Astrophysics
---

My name is **Sidharth Aroli-Veettil**, and I am a Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Astrophysics](https://astro.uc.cl/), [Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/).

I am part of the [Astrochemistry Group at PUC](https://vvguzman.com/), where my research focuses on the **chemistry of protoplanetary disks**, the **fractionation of nitrogen isotopes**, and the **emergence of prebiotic molecules** during planet formation. I use **ALMA** observations, **radiative transfer modeling**, and **molecular line analysis** to study how complex chemistry evolves in these environments.
