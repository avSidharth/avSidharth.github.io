**Abstract**  
> We demonstrate the efficacy of the **Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)** in identifying and characterizing **white dwarfs (WDs)** within the Milky Way. Leveraging the UVIT point-source catalogue toward the Small Magellanic Cloud and cross-matching it with **Gaia DR3** data, we identified **43 single WDs** (37 new detections), **13 WD + main-sequence candidates**, and **161 UV-bright main-sequence stars** by analyzing their spectral energy distributions.  
> Using **white dwarf evolutionary models**, we determined their **masses**, **effective temperatures** (*T*<sub>eff</sub>), and **cooling ages**. The WDs span **0.2–1.3 M<sub>⊙</sub>** in mass and **10 000–15 000 K** in temperature, with **cooling ages of 0.1–2 Gyr**. Notably, we detect WDs hotter than those reported in previous works, attributable to UVIT’s higher sensitivity.  
> We also report **20 new extremely low-mass WD candidates**. Despite Gaia DR3’s limitations for faint sources, we estimate a **local WD space density** of ρ<sub>WD</sub> ≈ 1.3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> pc<sup>−3</sup>, higher than earlier literature values.  
> These results showcase UVIT’s capabilities and pave the way for future UV missions such as **INSIST**, setting a precedent for large-scale WD discovery and spectroscopic follow-up.
